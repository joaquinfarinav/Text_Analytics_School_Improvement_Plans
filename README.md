Our understanding of improvement planning behaviors at the school level remains limited due to the predominant reliance on textual information, and the technical challenges it poses to analyze it at scale. This study develops comprehensive text analytics of school improvement plans in Chile from 2018 to 2022. Classical Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools such as POS tagging, sentiment analysis, and fuzzy substring matching are employed to classify and track school strategies, enabling the identification of patterns and trends. Spanish BERT is utilized to establish links between school actions and the National Learning Recovery Strategy. Fuzzy sentence clustering and keyword extraction models are applied to identify prominent clusters of school strategies based on thematic similarities. Finally, Latent Class Analysis is employed to classify schools into meaningful types, by aggregating scores at the school level. The findings aim to provide insights into the styles of improvement planning undertaken by schools in Chile, optimize monitoring and support from the Ministry, and foster more effective educational improvement processes nationwide.
